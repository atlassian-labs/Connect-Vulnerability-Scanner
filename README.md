# Connect Vulnerability Scanner
[![Apache license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE.txt) [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](CONTRIBUTING.md)
There are two types of vulnerabilities that this currently scans for:

1. (Reflected) XSS in the query parameters of module URLs
2. Possible secrets stored in app properties

## Installation:

1. Install [chromedriver](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/) and make sure that it is located in your `$PATH`
2. Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv .venv`
3. Enter the virtual environment using `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage:

```
python scan.py --username [USERNAME] --password [password] --api_token [API_TOKEN] --url [INSTANCE_URL] --descriptor [DESCRIPTOR_URL]
```

Note that if you want to scan a Confluence app installed in your instance, then the instance URL needs to end in '/wiki'.
The scanner needs a valid Atlassian account and an instance where the app is installed in order to function. The API_TOKEN is only required for the secret scanner in order to enumerate through the app properties.
The Atlassian account should be a member of the instance.

## TODO:

- [ ] Create a Dockerfile that bundles the scanner
- [ ] Migrate to Poetry
